# Tunisian Traffic Signal

Tunisian Traffic Signal is an application that allows users to report and monitor real-time traffic updates across Tunisia. The app is designed to help citizens navigate through traffic by providing a crowdsourced platform for traffic alerts, road conditions, and accidents. 

## Features

- **Real-time traffic reports**: Users can signal traffic conditions such as congestions, accidents, or roadblocks.
- **Map visualization**: Traffic signals are displayed on a map to help users visualize trouble spots.
- **Crowdsourced updates**: Citizens can contribute by posting live updates and reviewing the status of their route.
- **Traffic Alerts**: Push notifications to alert users of traffic jams or emergencies in their vicinity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design for reporting traffic conditions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django
- **Database**:  PostgreSQL
- **Map API**: Google Maps API 
- **Hosting**: Heroku 

## How It Works

1. **Signal Traffic**: Users submit traffic reports through the app by selecting a location on the map and choosing the type of traffic condition (e.g., accident, roadblock, congestion).
2. **Post Online**: Reports are posted in real time on the online map, accessible to all users.
3. **Monitor Traffic**: Citizens can monitor live traffic data, see alerts, and navigate alternative routes.
